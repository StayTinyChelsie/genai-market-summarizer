## 🧠 Project Description  
As someone who’s studied both AI and finance, I’ve noticed how overwhelming financial news and reports can be—especially when trying to make sense of it all quickly.  
This tool uses large language models to summarize earnings transcripts, market news, and financial reports, while scoring their sentiment (bullish, neutral, bearish).  
It also supports PDF uploads and exports results to Google Sheets.
